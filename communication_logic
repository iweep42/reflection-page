#communication,logic

In order to express, explain ext. I have to write long texts.
Over and over again, refering to the  original idea, if there were a class that represents the whole meaning, it would be much easier to communicate with.

Dramaticaly, my words doesn't catch up to my logic, and at some point, I get lost on what I was talking about. It isn't easy as it seems. 
Maybe for some people, it is just in the moment, easy to connect the dots because they had done that multiple times, but it is time consuming and overwhelming.
